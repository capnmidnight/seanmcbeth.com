  <Entry title="Doesn't Afraid" created="March 10th, 2008">
        So, a little while ago I wrote some .NET code that downloaded a given numbered user's
    profile page on &lt;a href="http://www.gamedev.net"&gt;GameDev.net&lt;/a&gt;,
    and parsed the page to get the user name and a little bit of text from one of
    their posts. Well, I just wrapped it all up into a SOAP Web Service, with a
    form that you can use to test it out &lt;a href="InstAfraid.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

  <Entry title="New Site" created="March 1st, 2008">
        Here it is, my new site. It took a while to get it running again,
    but hopefully I can keep up with the work load. The site has been
    completely redesigned, and is now running on a database backend.
    Hopefully, in the coming weeks I'll be able to develop a number of
    tools to help manage the site.
