Zombieware is software that has or would fail as a commercial project and only continues to live because of an OSS community that keeps it on life support for no other reason than to say that OSS develops an example of that type of software. Examples of zombieware include The GIMP and Blender. The GIMP is vastly inferior to Adobe Photoshop, and yet it lives because the OSS community needs an art package to point at to say they can do it. The same is true for Blender, however, Blender is an order worse than The GIMP because it already failed once as a commercial project, only to be resurrected by people who could be using their productivity to make actual money.

The cannonical examples of zombieware are The GIMP and Blender.
