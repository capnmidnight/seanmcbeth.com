I have a friend that I like to call the WootBot. He's a robot.

He's not doing anything right now, but when I say "Engage WootBot" --
 \__/  WOOT
 [OO]  WOOT
C[--]D WOOT
  ][   WOOT

Here's his JavaDoc
/**
*A robot that goes woot
*/
public class WootBot{
    /**
    * Engage the WootBot
    * @param wootCount - the number of times to say woot
    */
    public void engage(wootCount);
}
 
He likes to go woot. It makes him happy.

Otherwise, I try to save power and just shut him down

(his antennae retract. I thought that was a pretty cool feature)

My WootBot spotted Solid Snake.

But then Snake shot him with an EMP weapon.

He's not feeling too well now.
