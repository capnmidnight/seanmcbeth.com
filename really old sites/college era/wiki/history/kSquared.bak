I did a google search for kSquared and found this. I knew he was quite the cool dude, but I could have never imagined this.

I don't know much about Keith, but I already hate him.

(Mushu-Edit: kSquared's existance has yet to be proven. Though he exists on the internets in various forms, most notably being an entity on gamedev.net and #gamedev, this is not conclusive evidence. It has been speculated that kSquared could exist as a non-sentient entity which utilizes UVA's blue.unix cluster in a malicious fashion, or even, as suggested by kSquared itself, a non-corporeal entity which is manifested to some degree in each person. The subject is still highly debatable, and probably will remain in such a state until conclusive evidence is brought to light.)
