!News
*''11/25/2006'' '''Welcome two new developers:''' Andrew Hammer and Scott Mencer have joined the Horde.

!Done
*'''More Documentation:''' Better now, I'm caught up on documentation.
*'''Decal Editor:''' Decals are instance objects that are used for rendering. Instead of having a million polygons for a million stars, now there is one polygon (Decal), and a million star objects that reference it by an ID. I thought Decal was more of a descriptive name than "Sticker" or "Stamp" in this regard. Decals support seperate stroke and fill colors, as well as sub decals, i.e. different sections of the decal for different blocks of color. 
*'''Achieve Conservation of Momentum in Physics Subsystem:''' Unfortunately, still don't have conservation of energy. Bah!
*'''Sound Mixer:''' Now I just need good sounds to go with it.

!TODO
*'''Rewrite Map:''' It really sucks right now, very slow, graphical artifacts everywhere. I liked the grav field visualization that I had included, but it's very slow to generate so I cache it, it's not supposed to change, but keeping it up to date is difficult.
*'''Achieve Conservation of Energy in Physics Subsystem:''' I've got some help with this now.
*'''Serialized User Options:''' yeah, that would be a good idea.
*'''More Unit Testing:''' Getting a little bit better about this...
*'''Physics Server:''' Closer to this goal than previously, but still a ways off. First step to making the game multiplayer will be to get the solar system simulation running on a server instead of in the game client itself. It will require me to undo some optimization work that I've done.
*'''Content System:''' About 50% completely right now, now that I have the Decal Editor and the Decals are serializable.
*'''Space Stations:''' Space Stations, what's this? Docking? Orbit around planets? Destroying them with large rocks? Wot wot? Yeah, they're going to be awesome, but are currently just a pipe dream.
*'''Jump Gates:''' Thinking of doing them as irregular distortions in the graviational field. That makes sense to me.
