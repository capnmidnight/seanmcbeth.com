!Old West Graphic Story

I have this idea for a graphic novelle about the wild west. Every page would be detailed graphite sketches. I would create a basic mock up out of models of some type (live, miniature, don't know), and photograph it to get the choice of angle that I want. I haven't decided yet if I will just keep it photographed, or do just pure graphite sketches, or do some kind of hybrid. I've done some work retouching photos to give them CG cell shading look, but cell shading is not the style I want in this case.

In all honesty, I don't know if I'm a good story writer or not. I've never actually tried to seriously write a story before. Maybe I'll just get my sister to do it for me.
