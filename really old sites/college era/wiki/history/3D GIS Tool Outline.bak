!what?
*application for visuallizing GIS data in full motion, real time 3D
*combining powerful GIS tools with quality 3D rendering
!why?
*hot GIS topic
**competitor products
***ESRI ArcGlobe ("Looks worse than the original Duke Nukem 3D")
***Google Earth
***NASA World Wind
***Skyline TerraExplorer
***etc.
*opportunity for innovation
**Where competitors fail
***Useful tool, inferior graphics
***or,
***superior rendering capability, no useful features
!how?
*Comparisons with computer games
**terrain rendering
**information overlays
**real-time 3D picking is spatial query
**3D rendering is coordinate projection
*COTS renderers
**Unreal
**Torque
**etc.
*Extending current open source projects?
**NASA World Wind
!who?
*Sean T. McBeth (Developer)
*Scott Mencer (Developer)
*Tim Cooley (GIS Analyst)
!when?
	One full day a week to start, reevaluate after first milestone
