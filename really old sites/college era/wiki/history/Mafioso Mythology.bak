!Mafioso Mythology
This is an impromptu story telling project that I've been bantering about for about a year now. It started when, with a group of friends, I started pointing out different stars in the sky and explaining their significance in Greek and Roman mythology. At some point, Zeus took on the persona of an Italian mafia boss, and from there things blew up.

I started embellishing larges parts of the story, really only sticking to the general guidelines of each character. To tell you the truth, I couldn't remember the original stories that well. However, I'm not concerned, because this is consistent with the original *tradition* of the stories of mythology.

What we know today of the myths of the Olympians are gleened from mostly incomplete works, and some of them did not represent popular versions of the stories. We can see in our current copies a few overlapping stories, and many of the details are completely inconsistent. So, except for broad, general details like Odysseus wandering the Mediteranean Sea for decades, none of the original poets agreed on much of anything, and this is just amongst the few that we know of. So, I feel no qualms about embellishing the story as I go along.

I have considered changing the names of the characters. I think keeping them at least similar would be a good way of making my intentions completely explicit. I don't want people to think I'm plagiarizing the stories, I want them to know that I am intentionally copying and changing them. I've considred sticking to the Roman names exclusively. I prefer the Greek names for the gods -- the Roman traditions were too stuffy for my tastes -- but I think the Roman names will fit the theme better.

Since concepts of family are so important to the real mafia, I will mostly focus on the brotherhood of Zeus/Jupiter, Poseidon/Neptune, and Hades/Pluto.

!Characters
* Jupiter
He is the head of the family, the eldest brother, and the strongest. He's also an encourageable womanizer, and a drunk. Tucked inside his breast pocket is a IMI Desert Eagle .50 cal -- symbolic of Zeus' original thunderbolt.
** Juno
She is Jupiter's wife. She is immensley jealous of Jupiter and his infidelities and can become quite dangerous because of it. She often takes out hit contracts on Jupiter's lovers, or on his illegitimate offspring.

* Neptune
He is the owner of a chain of seafood resturaunt. He's Jupiter's favorite brother, and they often confide in each other. Jupiter doesn't like Neptune's employees, but they mostly get along.
** Salacia
She is Neptune's wife. She manages the original resturaunt of the chain while he manages the franchise.

* Pluto
He is the outsider of the family. He works as an undertaker at a funeral home and wants nothing to do with the family business. His brothers often visit him but he never visits his brothers. In fact, he is rarely seen out of the funeral home.
** Proserpina
She is Pluto's wife. She was once a super model, now she and Pluto never leave the house. Most people are confused as to why Proserpina stays with Pluto, as the latter is often consider extremely ugly.
