The C-Style Trigraphs are a set of ISO 646 character strings, 3 characters in length (hence the name Trigraph), that are used in place of a character that may not appear on certain, limited keyboards.

If this list does not display properly, please click the "edit" link below:

* ??= for #
* ??( for [
* ??) for ]
* ??< for {
* ??> for }
* ??/ for \
* ??! for |
* ??- for ~
* ??' for ^

Since RoWiki reserves many of those special characters as control characters, pages are broken when they are used in an article. Using Trigraphs prevents that breakage.

The C-Style Trigraphs are a set of ISO 646 character strings, 3 characters in length (hence the name Trigraph), that are used in place of specific characters that may not appear on certain, limited keyboards. They are called '''C-Style''' Trigraphs because of the need to represent the equivalent C programming language constructs on old Unix terminals.
