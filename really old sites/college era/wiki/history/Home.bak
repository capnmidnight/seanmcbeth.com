!What is Eye Witness?

Eye Witness is a site for telling the news as you see it. If you see something happen, you are qualified as an eye witness and may post about it. However, if you weren't there, you don't know jack shit about what happened and have nothing to add but speculation. If someone saw something you saw, you can corroborate or deny their story.

!Why Journalists Suck

A journalist is someone that reports on the news. They are supposed to be objective and are supposed to verify their facts. Guess what, they don't. Journalists know how to do one thing: write. Outside of the realm of writing, they are completely ignorant.

I have attended a number of events that journalists have reported on. I shudder to remember the completely innacurate representation of the events was eventually printed. Occurances of events were out of order, whole groups of people expressing specific opinions were completely omitted. Factual innacuracies were propagated. After speaking with the journalist that wrote these articles after the fact, the only answer I received was "well, I didn't feel that other stuff fit the message at hand". Guess what retard, your job is not to interpret or to propogate a specific message, your job is to report on the occurances as they happen.

!What Scares Me

I've read a number of articles on the web on topics that I have some expertise (Computer related topics, for instance), and I scream in indignation on how factually innacurate the articles are. They misuse jargon, they falisify statistics, they fabricate concepts. On other occasions, I've read a number of articles on the web on topics in which I have no expertise and comment on how thoughtful and insightful the article was. What's the difference? Could it be that there are no good in the field of Computers? Or is it more likely that ALL articles are misleading and inaccurate, and one can only tell when reading about something they know? I'm voting on the latter.

!Why a Wiki is a Bad Idea

A wiki is a bad idea because it has no "history". Oh, sure, it tracks changes and it keeps those changes available for viewing. But what you see is not that history, what you see is just a cross-section of that history, unless you take the initiative to dig further. I know people, people have no initiative whatsoever. So, the history is lost.

!Why I'm Not Going to do Anything About It.

Because I also lack initiative and roWiki was incredibly easy to install. Maybe later I'll switch to a forum format, but whatever, I'm lazy.

!What You Can Do

Just tell us what you saw. Don't try to spice it up with powerful language. Don't try to interpret what happened. Don't try to speculate on the outcome of the situation. Don't try to guess at the actor's motivations. Just tell as "person A struck person B across the face." That's all we need to know. If everyone who saw it could see it clearly, they'd all agree "yeah, person A hit person B." They will argue about person A being a hero or an asshole, but they will agree that person A's hand made contact with person B's face.

If two eye witnesses can't agree on some fact of an event, then it's best not to taint the reader's knowledge of that event with the contentious fact.
