	Italicized words in parentheses are OBL's explanations for why that particular bullet point
		is a included or notes from me
	List items are meant to be distilled to their bare meaning.
	A few items in the list are not in the same order that they appear in OBL's original letter.
		This is merely to increase organization. I have attempted to keep them as close (either
		before or after) to their original location as possible.
	Much of OBL's original statement is highly emotionally charged. I have attempted to minimize the use
		of emotional words.
	OBL mainly uses pronouns like "us," "we," and "you," "they". I have changed them to what I feel are as near
		to what he meant as possible. 
	In many instances OBL presumes to speak for all Muslims. Remember that he does not. I will try to address this
		issue in the future in the distillation itself.
	As always, the full original statement is available for comparison to this list at the link above
