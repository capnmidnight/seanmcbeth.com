I'm selling most of my games. You can find more info in [this thread|http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=411681]. Games with an asterisk (*) next to their names have the manuals. Only one game has the full box, Metal Gear for the NES. All the other games are sans-box. A double asterisk means that the PC game also includes the original inserts, like tech-trees from Real Time Strategy games. Other games may have the manuals as well, I just can't find them until I clear some of this other stuff out.

Games that have a bullet before their name have someone interested in them. This is mostly just a note taking process on my behalf. I'll remove any games that are sold. It's first paid, first served, and I give preference to members of [GameDev|http://www.gamedev.net/]
