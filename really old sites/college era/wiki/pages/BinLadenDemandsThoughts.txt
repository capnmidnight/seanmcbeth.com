{
	These are personal thoughts that I had on each of his points
}

(Q1) Why are Muslims fighting and opposing America? 

*To avenge deaths of Palestinians at the hands of Israelis 
*Because America attacked Islam and continues to attack Islam
**In Palestine 
***by helping the British to create Israel
***by asserting the Jewish and not the Muslim claim to Paletine
''(To be fair, this isn't about Jews being in Palestine, this is about Jews being on Earth. OBL is so full of hatred for Jews that I doubt anything short of their extermination would be acceptable to him. I personally see the Jewish people as sort of a grandfather figure to my own religion, and while I believe their religion is incorrect, I still feel they deserve respect. Jesus Christ himself was a Jew, afterall. I often question why we as Christians don't observe some of the traditional Jewish customs that are based on historical events, like Hannukah.)''
**In Somalia ''(I still don't know why we were there, or why we didn't do a good job of it. Thanks Clinton,)''
**In Checnya
***by supporting the Russian government ''(I can see where OBL is confused, we did help him knock back the Russians in Afghanistan. It's interesting to note that in the original letter he threatens to oust the US like he did the Russians. Unfortunately him, I don't thik anyone is going to help him on that one, unless he can convince China to get rid of WalMart)''
**In Kashmir
***by supporting the Indian government ''(I have a lot of Indian friends, Sikhs mostly, and they all hate Pakistanis with a burning passion. Other than that, they're pretty rational people.)''
**In Lebanon
***by supporting the Israeli government ''(Okay, they are our allies, what do you expect? It's not like Lebanon or Palestine has done much to curry our favor. You help your friends.)''
**Through the governments of Muslim countries as agents of America, by supervision, consent, and orders 
***by preventing the establishment of the Islamic Shariah 
***by humiliating and threatening Muslims
***by stealing the wealth the Ummah ''(Muslim community)'' and selling it to America at unfair prices.
***by the transference of land to Israel ''(dude, get off it)''
**by using international influence and military threats to influence the price of oil ''(Recent pictures of silver plated Cadillacs and indoor ski resorts in the middle of the deserts of Dubai seem to convince me otherwise)''
**by building military bases in Muslim countries ''(Every country should be so lucky to have an American military base)''
**by sanctioning Iraq ''(They wouldn't have starved if it weren't for the Oil-for-Food debacle)''
**by supporting the Jewish claim to Jerusalem ''(He repeats himself a lot. You'll get over it)''
***by building an embassy in Jerusalem
***by allowing Ariel Sharon to enter the Al-Aqsa mosque
*To aid in the removal of the non-Muslim governments of Muslim countries
*For other, similar reasons ''(presumably too numerable to list)''
*For revenge ''(The lord said "Revenge is Mine". OBL claims to recognize all the "prophets," so that means he has to remember [Romans 12:19|http://bible.cc/romans/12-19.htm])''
*Attacks against civilians are justified because:
**The government is elected by civilians
**Civilians pay the taxes that fund the government and military
**The military recruits civilians
**The military recruits both men and women
**Muslim civilians were also killed
''(While this all makes excellent martial sense, in that destruction of infrastructure is a consistent way of dispatching your enemies, it still isn't justification, for anyone, anywhere. To wrongs don't make a right, but three rights make a left.)''
*Violence is the only language the American Government understands ''(Or English, we like English)''

(Q2) What do Muslims want from America?
*Convert to Islam ''('kay, he had to have known that this would never happen. At this point we see that this letter is not intended for America to read and comply to, this letter is just another soap-box, and OBL is just trying to get his version of the story out.)''
**Submit to God's laws
**Discard all false relgions ''(Again, he knows we aren't going to do this, as he knows that The Constitution basically amounts to a State Religion)''
**Stop:
***Oppresing
***Lying
***Being immoral
***Acting with debauchery ''(Actually that's not a bad idea)''
**Be:
***well mannered
***principled
***honorable
***pure ''(yeah, those sound pretty good, too)''
**Reject:
***fornication ''(I can see his point. Even for most people that voluntarily accept this as a sin within their personal belief system ignore it, merely because it's inconvenient.)''
***homosexuality ''(eh...)''
***intoxicants ''(But... my beer..)''
***gambling ''(I blame this on the poor math education in America)''
***"trading with interest" ''(I'm not sure what he means by this)''
*Honestly evaluate itself as immoral and hypocritical:
**Making laws outside of Sharia Law ''(Generally that's what non-Muslims do)''
**Seperating Religion from Politics ''(yawn)''
**Permiting usury ''(definition: charging unreasonable interest on loans. In context I believe he means any level of debt)''
**Building an economy and investments on usury
**Allowing the Jews to take control of the economy and media
**Permiting production, trading, and usage of intoxicants
**Tolerating narcotic usage
**Permiting acts of immorality
**Permiting gambling
**Exploiting women ''(right... what's a Burkha again?)''
**Trading in sex
**Spreading "new" diseases ''(and they are most rampant in predominately Muslim African countries)''
**Polluting heavily ''(eh, not as much as China)''
**Refusing to sign the Kyoto agreement ''(Out of protest because it doesn't limit China enough)''
**Giving power to the rich, and thusly, the Jews ''(There we go again, can't go 15 minutes without a "fuck y'all jews")''
**Using the nuclear bomb in WWII to hasten the inevitable and planned surrender by the Japanese ''(Did anyone know what it would do, what it would mean? It's amazing those were the ONLY ones EVER used in aggression by ANYONE in history)''
**Suppressing democracy when it leads to choices it deems unfavorable ''(yeah, that one kind of sucks)''
**Selectively applying anti-WMD-proliferation policies that favor Israel ''(it's kind of hard to put the cat back in the bag)''
**Ignoring, seeking immunity from, protecting Israel from violations of, and punshing other violators of International Law ''(For a man that believes only in Shariah Law, he places quite a bit of import in International Law.)''
*Stop supporting interests in opposition to Muslims
**Israel
**India in Kashmir
**Russia against the Chechens
**Manila against the Muslims in Southern Philippines. 
*Leave Muslim countries 
*End support for corrupt governments of Muslim Countries ''(thank you, for that flasback. I was looking for one and couldn't find it)''
*Deal with Muslims on the basis of mutual interests and benefits
''(just don't cut off my head, please)''
