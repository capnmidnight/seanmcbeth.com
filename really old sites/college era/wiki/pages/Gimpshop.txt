It may sort of look like Photoshop, but it is still The GIMP. The GIMP is what I like to call "zombieware," software that would have failed as a commercial software project, but lives into perpetuity thanks to a rabid open source software community willing to dedicate countless hours without compensation just so they can claim "OSS has successfully developed Software Type XYZ".

While GIMPShop does address the horrifying affront to humanity that was the GIMP's user interface, as it is merely a menu script rewrite (never touching the underlying code), it does nothing to address any of the problems with The GIMP's features. First and foremost, it is very unstable on Windows; I've never been able to use it for longer than half an hour at a time. It lacks color management features that are vital in printing. It can't handle digital camera raw files, making it essentially useless for serious photomanipulation. The only automation system that it has is its scripting plugin system, meaning any non-programmers won't be able to use it to set up common tasks.

If you haven't guessed, The GIMP and I have done battle before. When it comes to graphics packages, you really do get what you pay for. I've been using Photoshop since version 7, and I've used The GIMP on a number of occasions. I frequently revisit The GIMP to see how it's doing and even today it's not up to the level of even Photoshop v7. Photoshop is now in v10, I doubt the GIMP will ever be able to catch up. For the features that the GIMP lacks, its only suitable market segment (home users) is easily covered by Paint.NET or Photoshop Elements.
