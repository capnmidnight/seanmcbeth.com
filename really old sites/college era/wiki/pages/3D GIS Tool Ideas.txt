!virtual collaberation on GIS data
*A scenario: ground responce units are briefed on the projected effect of soil errosion due to heavy storm activity, with time-lapse visualizations "from the ground".
	
!state-of-the-art rendering and visualizations
*providing the user with a more concrete concept of the presented data.
	
!hardware accelerated graphics
*wrestling with slow applications is frustrating.
*frustration leads to product "shelf death" (user never uses product, product sits on shelf)

!hardware accelerated GIS operations
*graphics and GIS share many similarities
**a lot of on-the-fly projections of large numbers of vertex data
*dedicated graphics cards are essential to high quality graphics
**GPUs are SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) architecture
**CPUs are SISD design
*[Generic GPU Programming|http://www.gpgpu.org] may be possible to leverage the SIMD architecture of the GPU for GIS work
	
!import DEM on-the-fly
*DEM may be ideal format
**standardized
**common in GIS work
**variable resolution
**very detailed
*on-the-fly importing allows for special caching features

!recording
*user actions for playback in viewer
*xvid video for playback in media player w/ codec
*opens market to commercial media
**currently media houses utilize
***costly in house apps
***one of the aformentioned poor-quality, 3rd party apps
**a high quality 3D terrain renderer with GIS layering and video recording capabilities will be very cost effective for journalists and documentors.
