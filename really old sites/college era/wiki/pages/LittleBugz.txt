!!!LittleBugz - Defect Tracking for Small Projects

!!Purpose
LittleBugz is a free (''gratis,'' I do not release ideologically free software), easy to install, easy to administer, easy to use sytem for tracking program defects in small projects. Incidentally, that means LittleBugz could benefit from itself.

Currently, there are no such defect tracking systems. Hobbyist and beginner developers are stuck attempting to wrangle a much larger and complex system (e.g. Bugzilla), and often find the experience discouraging. By providing a simple to use defect tracking system, I hope to encourage and reinforce one aspect of good software development practices in growing developers.
