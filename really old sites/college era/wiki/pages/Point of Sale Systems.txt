!Point of Sale Consoles
Most pubs and resturaunts in the Harrisburg, PA area use a computerized ordering system for tallying the bills that is provided by a specific company. It's basically a touch screen menu where you can select different menu items or whatnot and it automatically calculates the total. Some systems encorporate inventory tracking and payroll.

Only one company in my area that is installing them right now, and they're doing a really shitty job. I mean, they're still using Windows NT 4.0. That's a downright travesty, I can't imagine how it can even work. Actually, I know it doesn't work, I had to repair one at lunch just as the place was opening (got free lunch with drinks for my entire group and the admiration of the owner out of it!).

Even a large resturaunt won't have a particularly large database of items, relatively speaking (when I think "large database" I think of Walmart's inventory system). The tallying system itself can't be hard, we all practically code it at least once in one of our intro-to-programming courses. List a bunch of items, add them up, split into seperate bills for seperate customers if need-be, add sales tax, what else?

The only issues that I can think of are stability and usability: it can't ever crash and it must be extremely easy to use. However, the concept is so simple that you'd have to be a retarded monkey to screw it up!

The current company charges a flat fee for the initial installation, with fees for updates. Service before 5pm is free, after is a flat fee, something like $150. I expect that most resturaunts will have most of their problems after 5.

I might even try to get a job at a place that uses one so that I can do some field research on the use of the system, and hear the griping points from the "front line".

There's more to it than just printing up an order. The really good systems will do more than that. They handle payroll, balance sheets, accouting reports, scheduling, inventory, pricing, ordering. Ours would print up weekly reports predicting we were out of certain items, and show us stats on what dishes sold best over the week. We'd clock in and clock out with it, and even request our days off with it. Was like a small internet at work. =)

No one individual system is overly complicated, but they usually tie them all in together. I've worked in restaurants for many many years and have often thought of this as a possible place to start a small business making restauarant systems like this. Would be a good money maker I bet.

Touch screens, in general, have the same output as a touchpad on a laptop. Knowing this is making it VERY easy for me to make the sale software for the business I'm opening. Basically, all it does is query an SQL database for product info and prices, and then works (sort of, its kinda buggy still, since theres a lot of legal issues) with the Interac system for the bank, or the till itself. Basic operations like change amounts and all that could easily be made by a chimp. I mean, I coded this entire thing in VB, and it took me MAYBE a week and a half to get the basics of it working.

So the hard part? Mainly getting it to work with banks. There are a LOT of security issues you have to deal with when using a system that allows people to make debit transactions. But thats about it.

Most banks have transaction fees as opposed to licensing fees up here. Instead of the bank taking a set amount every month, they take a little of the transactions, leading to a slimmer profit margin. As for a standard interface, sort of. There are a couple of different card standards that will have to be programmed in for a machine to accept them.

The spiffiest system I used (ex-waiter) would also send the orders to printers in the bar and kitchen (drinks to the bar and food to the kitchen). It's a very simple feature but the crew really appreciated it.

I'm far from being an expert and this isn't anything I care to make my life out of but, from the limited view I've had of the point of sale (POS) industry, NT4 sounds about right. Imagine technology like that with the banking regulations and legal hoops that you'd expect and you have a REALLY good view of what it's like. But don't forget about cut-throat sales agreements and compitiion. Lots of that too. But then, where wouldn't you find that.

The research I've done went nowhere and isn't complete but other people might get further. Here's some random pieces of info I've picked up on the topic.

The application fee for Interac membership is $1000.

Using a card reader to get info from a card doesn't seem overly complicated [linky|http://stripesnoop.sourceforge.net/].

Try searching for info on point of sale (POS) devices. There's a few SDK's out there. I think that's the starting point. Seems most devices end up communicating data through a serial port (some might use TCP/IP) to a switch.

This is where things got murky.

A transaction usually involves some communication with a "switch". I think there's quite a few companys in the states that run their own switches. You probably won't get info on how to communicate with a switch. Setting up your own would be expensive to say the least (see "Roll your Own" in Q20 [here|http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/showfaq.asp?forum_id=15] and then expect to pay maybe * 10 more and this doesn't include the cost of the software). 

Your device talks to the switch, the switch talks to the bank, money goes into a settling account if the transaction is approved, everybody involved takes a couple pennies per transaction and if I understand correctly those pennies come from the store where the transaction occured. Those pennies add up when you have enough transactions through several POS devices.

I have very recent and direct experience with this, since my father recently upgraded the systems in his rest. 

I will start by saying it is f*** expensive for this kind of software. You have to buy 1 license for every computer you run, and a lic. usually cost around $800+ for quality software. Don't get me started on the hardware. Unless you get it at an auction, a decent P.O.S. printer costs about $600. If you want to know why they use old junky software/hardware, its because it costs a lot of money to upgrade to good stuff. (note: we built our own PC's for the job)

As for the credit card readers/interface, its simply plugged into the PS2 port, and when you swipe the card its like typing a lot of keys really really fast (or at least ours are, i believe there are USB solutions also). Its that simple. The actual software to run credit cards is separate from the POS software. It runs about $500 for a site license, and must be made to interface with many POS solutions. Likewise, the POS software must have an interface to interact with the merchant software. 

There are some complexities I haven't seen mentioned, such as printer output formatting. A very important part of the system is that the printers print in a layout you like. You can send the order to the kitchen 10 times, but if they can't read it easily you are screwed.

Then there is the simplicity and ease of use of the system. Unless you have direct experience, as a waiter/manager/etc.., you would not know what is easy and fast for an interface. 

I'm tired of thinking about this, you get so many problems (like finding out your merchant system can't work with a USB modem or winmodem, and then having to discover your windows install has a screwed up serial drivers when the serial modem doesn't work either. fun stuff)
