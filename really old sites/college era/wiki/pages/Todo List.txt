Okay, so this page is just full of ramblings. It's meant to be a complete stream of conciousness. Thoughts that pop into my mind go here. Yes, I think in bulleted lists... God I'm obsessive-compulsive.

Once this list is compiled, the question becomes, "What am I doing to fulfill this list." Right now, the answer is "get out of debt." I am working so hard to get rid of any debt that I have right now so I can have time to actually pursue these dreams. Or, at least that is what I'm telling myself that I'm doing right now. I don't know, maybe I'm just procrastinating.

I want to:
*Travel the world -''(a long trip, a few months perhaps, stay in hostels, travel by train. Alternatively, I could travel Europe by relearning German and getting a job in Germany, travelling on the weekends)''
**the major cities -''(London, Berlin, Augsburg (have to, born there), Paris, Barcelona, Pisa, Moscow, Tokyo, Sydney, I'm leaving a lot out)''
***history -''(Scotland, land of my heritage)''
****''UPDATE: Scotland +1!! Yay!''
***art
***food -''(If I ever eat at a McDonalds while away from home, please someone shoot me)''
**Visit GDNet "friends" -''(Lord help us all)''
**wander across a continent, Alby Mangels style -''(yeah, this is kind of crazy)''
*Own a resturaunt, and cook the kind of food I like to eat -''(I don't think money is a big issue, that's what small business loans are for)''
**what is that food? -''(my travel plans would help with this)''
**Culinary School? -''(I'd really like to pay off my car first, which I think is feasible within the next 5 years)''
*Build a robot
**battlebot
**wootbot
**blalahb
*Paint
**something huge
**something complex, with a bunch of different pieces, all intermingled, in a total composition. It's multiple pieces that make the whole work, it's 2D elements that make a 3D piece. I don't knooooooow!!!
*Earn a Ph.D. in Computer Science researching techniques in CG, probably non-photorealistic rendering, probably optical illusions -''(I need to: retake the GRE (my scores have expired), restudy algorithms and retake the GRE subject test (didn't do too well the first time), get into contact with a few people that are in the programs I want to enter, and apply)''
*Photography 
**''UPDATE: Camera Aquired!''
**macro shots. I like to pay attention to things that people miss. People move too quickly through life and miss out on the beauty of the miniature world. I even miss it, but sometimes I see it, and I want to remind people that there is beauty in the world around them, every day, if they only stop and look closely enough. To me, this is the source of my faith in God. Only a divine creature could create an entire universe of beauty.
**models
***''UPDATE: have done 2 model shoots so far!''
**cars. all day long.
*rebuild a car -''(The first project car I want to spend a max of $500 on the car itself. That would probably be the Beetle and maybe a 4th gen Civic)''
