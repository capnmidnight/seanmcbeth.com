I did a google search for kSquared and found this. I knew he was quite the cool dude, but I could have never imagined this. Our dear kSquared assures us this is not him, which we are fairly certain he is correct. Don't the girls in the 4th pic in the film strip look like trannies?

I don't know much about Keith, but I already hate him.

He looks JUST LIKE THIS

(Mushu-Edit: kSquared's existance has yet to be proven. Though he exists on the internets in various forms, most notably being an entity on gamedev.net and #gamedev, this is not conclusive evidence. It has been speculated that kSquared could exist as a non-sentient entity which utilizes UVA's blue.unix cluster in a malicious fashion, or even, as suggested by kSquared itself, a non-corporeal entity which is manifested to some degree in each person. The subject is still highly debatable, and probably will remain in such a state until conclusive evidence is brought to light.)
