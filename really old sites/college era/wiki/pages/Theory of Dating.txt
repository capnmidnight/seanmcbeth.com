!!!1. Getting Started
The shy person can't even work up the nerve to go talk to a [woman] that he is attracted to. Perhaps some formulaic definitions will help convince him that he must overcome this irrational behavior or else be doomed to a deep, dark chasm of despair.
!!1.1 Mathematics
Much can be said about dating and talking to women from a mathematical standpoint
!1.1.1 Game Theory
Game theory helps one to make decisions by evaluating the average reward of controllable choices coupled with uncontrollable outcomes. Talking to girls is easy when you reallize that success is not possible without it.

table a:
{A = you talk to a girl
B = she is receptive to advances
+ = positive outcome
0 = neutral outcome
- = negative outcome
________________
|    |  A | !A |
================
|  B |  + |  - |
================
| !B |  0 |  0 |
================}
In this table, the guy has control only over his own actions, A, whether or not he talks to the girl. We can and will consider B to be a random event (indeed, imperical evidence suggests this to be true). As a man can never know what a woman is thinking, we do not define B as "she ''likes'' you," as that is a fundamentally unknowable value for a man. Indeed, the possibility remains for a women who does not ''like'' you to be receptive to your advances. Whether this is a positive outcome or not is undefined, souly dependant on how it manifests in her actions.  If her actions never show that she does not like you, then it is functionally equivalent to her actually liking you.

The table shows that the only possible positive outcomes occur from a strict "talking to girls" policy. In each case, when the subject of the approach is unreceptive to advances, the outcome is merely neutral, one is no worse off than they were before the act (or lack thereof) of hitting on the girl. However, if one chooses the path of inaction and thereby misses a chance with one of the random receptive women, then this is clearly a negative outcome.

'''Definition 1:'''
''The average outcome of a strict "talking to girls" policy is always positive''
'''Corollary'''
''The average outcome of a strict "no talking to girls" policy is always negative''
!1.1.2 Statistics
There is a certain probability that you will receive a positive response from any particular girl. This probability is unknown. Realistically, this probability cannot be determined for the entire population of women. However, with a significantly large sample, the probability can be approximated to a certain degree of accuracy. 

This is complicated by the fact that the female population consists of two sub populations, those who are seeking intimate relations and those who are not. The probability of finding a date therefore decreases dramatically if one selects it sample from a homogeneous group of the two subpopulations (i.e. the class room environment, the workplace, etc.). Therefore, it is necessary to introduce selection bias and seperate out the desireable sub population.

We will consider an actual 0 probability of success as a statistical outlier. The occurances of a true 0 probability of success are few and far between, and usually linked to disfiguring conditions. As such, a disfiguring condition is not a garauntee of a true 0 probability of success.

Given an non-zero, but unknown probability ''P'' of successful attempt at propositioning a woman, then the total probability of having 1 success over a population ''N'' of subjects is therefore ''PN''. If we consider the worst-case scenario of ''P'' being fixed, than one only has control over ''N''. Knowing that ''P'' is non-zero, therefore ''PN'' approaches 1+ as ''N'' approaches infinity. Therefore, one should talk to as many women as possible over the course of their dating career.

!1.1.3 Boolean Algebra
Considering the manner in which she views you ("like" as in a romantic way, "dislike" as in not interested in a romantic relationship), possible quality levels of your pitch, and her acceptance of your proposal, we can judge the quality of the outcome, and generate a truth table:
{
|she likes | you approached | she goes (C)|| this is   (D)
|you (A)   | well (B)       | out w/ you  || a good outcome
|===========================================================
|     0    |      0         |    0        ||    1
|     0    |      0         |    1        ||    0
|     0    |      1         |    0        ||    1
|     0    |      1         |    1        ||    0
|     1    |      0         |    0        ||    0
|     1    |      0         |    1        ||    1
|     1    |      1         |    0        ||    0
|     1    |      1         |    1        ||    1
}You don't want to date someone that doesn't like you, because the relationship is doomed from the start. As you can see, d = f(a,b,c) = (¬A¬C)+(AC). B (the quality of your approach) is not an issue at all.

A better equation for D would be (¬A¬C)+A, because in the cases of ABC = 100, 110, it begs the question, if she likes you, but doesn't want to go out with you, then how mentally stable is she? In these cases, you've saved yourself the trouble of dating a mentally unstable person, and the number of positive outcomes dwarfs the number of negative outcomes (6 to 2, or 75% of all outcomes)

So, the mere act of approaching has a 50-75% chance of having a "good" outcome.

!!1.2 Social Science
Dating is fundamentally a social phenomena, and thusly a guide on dating would be remiss to not mention sociological viewpoints.
!1.2.1 Economics
Studying the opportunity cost of the outcomes, a "no" response leaves you no worse off than when you started. The only price is the time you spent approaching the girl. The OC of a "yes" response, however, is much different, as now you will have a time and money investment in dating the girl, but a number of benefits as well. If you are considering dating, then you must have already decided that the benefits outway the costs. Therefore, the "approach" is a "nothing to lose, everything to gain" game. I dare you to find a better deal.

Conversley, there is a certain value to the time you spend in approach and propositioning a woman. If it turns out that the particular subject you have approached is not interested in your proposition, then the time you have spent with her up to this point is known as a "sunk cost", and is irrechievable. Continuing the conversation only increases your total sunk cost on that subject, which decreases the total time resource you have to expend on more promissing subjects. As your time and money resources are limited, the only way to maximize the number of subjects ''N'', one must minimize the usage of resources in the act of propositioning subjects. Therefore, it is prudent to never buy girls drinks, and cut one's loses early if she begins to show disinterest.
