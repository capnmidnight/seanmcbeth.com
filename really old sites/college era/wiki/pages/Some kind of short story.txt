I ran today. I don’t mean jogging. Jogging is something you do when you are trying to get into shape and have no money for a gym membership. No, I am quite certain one cannot be more physically fit than I am, and as for money – never been an issue.

I took some pictures today. I don’t mean that I photographed something. That would imply that I had a camera, and that the images would then need to be developed. Perhaps it is more accurate to say that I took pieces of paper on which images were printed.

I took some pictures and then I ran. These two events are linked in a causal relationship. The specific linking event might be a desire to lead a full and healthy lifestyle, with art, exercise, and the benefits thereof. I’m pretty sure that’s not it. Maybe it was the men with guns.
