I pretty much entirely agree with you. I don't want the Lounge to go, per se; I want the crappy, intolerant, tired and uninspired threads that exist as a circle-jerk for racists/atheists/religious intolerants/liberal-bashing/conservative-bashing/etc to go. If the community can't abide by that, then the most extreme reaction GDNet LLC can take is to close the Lounge.
<br><br>
Hopefully it never comes to that.
<br><br>
ASCII Fishtank and 3H-GDC were some of the most inspired thread series in the Lounge in recent memory. We need more of those, not less. We need less information about APC's third testicle.
<br><br>
We need the Lounge to be a more interesting place to visit.

You may or may not want my official opinion on the whole "the Lounge: Yay, or Nay" topic. I think the Lounge serves a vital roll to the site. I definitely agree that certain types of threads run counter to the desired image of the site. But ultimately, I hope that the Lounge stays, and tries to maximize some of the things that have made it so great.
<br><br>
I feel that I have always "gotten" what the Lounge is about, especially after my brief spat of trouble getting banned every other week. I admit, I'm a bit biased in this regard. The Lounge is where I spend 90% of my time when I come to GDNet. I'll sometimes poke around the .NET and Java forums, but I am definitely a Lounge Lizard in that regard.
<br><br>
I've always described the Lounge with the analogy of a toilet. You shit in the toilet, it's naturally a dirty place. But you shit in the toilet so that you don't muss up the rest of your house. On the same token, you also clean your toilet, because letting even a little bit of dirt go quickly turns into a disgusting mess that stains the porcelain permanently.
<br><br>
That is what the Lounge is to GDNet, it's the toilet that attracts all the shit away from the technical forums. Obviously, through this anology, I support moderation over the Lounge with extreme prejudice.
<br><br>
I know GDNet wants to portray a specific image, one of professionalism but not stuffy corporatism. I definitely think that the religion, politics, and sex threads detract from that image. I can only imagine how many people are put off and never come back because they glimpse over thread titles like "Bush Lied!" and "The Bible for Athiests". I know I can feel very frustrated and exasperated when coming in and seeing thread titles that very obviously point out that it's just going to be another X bashing thread. It's definitely not just a matter of "If you don't like it, don't read it" as Mithrandir has said. Even thread titles alone can create a certain atmosphere here. Just last week I came in and saw three political threads that were very obviously heavily anti-conservative, and that makes me feel very unwelcome (in a place that is practically my "home," if one could call a website such a thing).
<br><br>
The ambiguously titled threads don't help, either. I'm very likely to read an ambiguously titled thread, and I'm also likely to forget what that thread is about by the next day I come to the boards. So, if "What is this...?" turns out to be a thread about penile enhancement, then I'm going to end up opening that thread multiple times, and regretting every one of them, merely because the thread title isn't descriptive enough.
<br><br>
I don't agree that so-called "inane" threads like "Talk Like A Pirate Day" are worthless in the context of the desired image of GDNet. I think they specifically garner a sense of community around here, a light hearted, *relaxing* (hint: you lounge to relax) image. The site is ultimately about making games, and you can't make good games if you don't know how to have fun. There have been some very fun threads; "ASCII Fishtank Contest," "Pictures of You" (before page 23), "Omega Compression Algorithm," all styles of posts of which I have actively been attempting to revive in recent times, in my own way. I think it all relates back to the humorous aspects of Geek Subculture, and that's why it fits so well on a programming website.
<br><br>
"3H-GDC" is one aspect of my attempts to rekindle some of the better parts of our community. Friendly competition, crazy ideas, masochistic requirements for the sake of challenge, etc. the support that I have received from the moderators in running the contest shows to me that GDNet is also interested in rekindling that atmosphere as well.
<br><br>
I want to see the Lounge continue, if only so that I have a reason to keep coming here every day. I wouldn't leave if the Lounge left, but I wouldn't have much reason to visit frequently.
