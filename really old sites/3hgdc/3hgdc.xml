  <Entry title="3H-GDC mark I" created="???">For the &lt;a href="Default.aspx?page=3hgdc/mI/mI.xml"&gt;first 3H-GDC,&lt;/a&gt; we were just starting to figure out how everything was going to work. The theme was "Black and White", so everyone had to make games that used no color in the graphics. This is the only 3H-GDC in which I participated, to try to set the tone for the contest and because there were only two other contestants.</Entry>
