  <Entry title="3H-GDC mark I" created="???">&lt;center&gt;&lt;h1&gt;The first 3H-GDC.&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
For the first 3H-GDC, we were just starting to figure out how everything was going to work. The theme was &lt;span style="color:black;background-color:white"&gt;black&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span style="color:white;background-color:black"&gt;white&lt;/span&gt;, so everyone had to make games that used no color in the graphics. This is the only 3H-GDC in which I participated, to try to set the tone for the contest and because there were only two other contestants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Unfortunately, downloads of the games aren't available. I hadn't figured out at the time that I wanted to keep a history of the games, so I didn't keep the entries. Oh well, we were learning as we went.</Entry>
