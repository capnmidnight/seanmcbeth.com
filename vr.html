Here are a most of the devices I own.</p><h3>Available</h3><p>These are headsets that I currently own and have on-hand.</p><h4>Tethered PC Virtual Reality</h4><ul><li><a href="https://www.vive.com/us/product/vive-virtual-reality-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTC Vive</a>: My standard Vive is equipped with the <a href="https://www.vive.com/us/vive-deluxe-audio-strap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deluxe Audio Strap</a> and the <a href="https://www.tpcastvr.com/store/TPCAST-Wireless-Adapter-for-VIVE-p93101456" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TPCAST Wireless Adapater</a>. I also have two <a href="https://www.vive.com/us/vive-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vive Trackers</a> with hand straps.</li><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/hmd/windows-mixed-reality/hmd-odyssey-windows-mixed-reality-headset-xe800zba-hc1us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung Odyssey+</a>: Just received, I haven't taken it out of the box yet.</li><li><a href="https://www8.hp.com/us/en/campaigns/mixedrealityheadset/overview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HP Windows Mixed Reality Headset</a>: Often my go-to headset, for ergonmics, ease of setup, and quality of visuals.</li><li><a href="https://www.oculus.com/rift-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oculus Rift S</a>: Just received, I haven't taken it out of the box yet.</li><li><a href="https://www.oculus.com/go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oculus Go</a>: A fine 3DOF headset at an incredible price.</li><li><a href="https://www.oculus.com/rift" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oculus Rift CV1</a>: I don't really like this headset. I think it was a lackluster release from a company that hyped it up way too much. At the time it came out, I bought an HTC Vive instead. But I now have a Rift CV1 to round out the library.</li><li><a href="https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/gear-vr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Samsung Gear VR</a>: I have a SM-R324 version, with the motion controller, of the Gear VR (the last white version they distrubeted) with a Samsung Galaxy S8 to run in it. This was the first mobile VR headset I used on a regular basis, and even bought my father one for his phone.</li><li><a href="https://developer.oculus.com/blog/open-source-release-of-rift-dk2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oculus Rift DK2</a>: I still have my first "real" VR headset.</li></ul><h4>Mobile Virtual Reality</h4><ul><li><a href="https://www.oculus.com/quest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Oculus Quest</a>: Rapidly becoming my favorite headset. Untethered plus boundless tracking is min-spec, in my mind.</li><li><a href="https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/virtual-reality-and-smart-devices/virtual-and-augmented-reality/lenovo-mirage-solo/Mirage-Solo/p/ZZIRZRHVR01" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lenovo Mirage Solo</a>: I wish this headset had delayed to include the 6DOF controllers. It's an excellent headset, and I enjoy working in the Daydream ecosystem.</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Pixel 2</a>: I have a Google Pixel 2 for ARCore projects. It is my daily-driver phone.</li><li><a href="https://vr.google.com/daydream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Daydream</a>: I have a Daydream View 2 with a Google Pixel 2 smartphone. The smartphone is my daily-driver. I have two standard 3DOF controllers for it.</li><li><a href="https://enterprise.vive.com/us/vivefocus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vive Focus</a>: It's not my favorite headset, but there are some interesting enterprise capabilities around device management that could make it a decent consideration.</li><li><a href="https://vr.google.com/cardboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cardboard</a>: I easily have a dozen different "dumb" slot-in-smartphone headsets, both purchased and of my own creation.</li><li><em>Pico Neo DK</em> I have a Pico Neo dev-kit, which is a 3DOF headset with a gamepad controlller. It's interesting from a historical perspective.</li></ul><h4>Augmented Reality</h4><ul><li><a href="https://www.magicleap.com/magic-leap-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Magic Leap One: Creator Edition</a>: I have my own Magic Leap One, which I consider to be the best AR headset that you can actually buy. Unfortunately, the Microsoft HoloLens devices have become incredibly impossible to acquire.</li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-hololens-development-edition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft HoloLens 1</a>: The device is starting to get a bit long-in-the-tooth, but I also think its capabilities have yet to be fully tapped in any extant applications.</li><li><a href="https://www.apple.com/ipad-9.7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apple iPad (2017) 9.7&quot;</a>: This is the current model of regular iPad, as of this writing. It comes with the A10 chipset, which is compatible with ARKit.</li></ul><h4>Other devices</h4><ul><li><a href="https://store.intelrealsense.com/buy-intel-realsense-tracking-camera-t265.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel RealSense T265</a>: This is the most recent tracking module that Intel offers in the RealSense line. I intend to build my own "audio-only" headset with it.</li><li><a href="https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435i/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Intel RealSense D435i</a>: This is the most recent 3D mapping module that Intel offers in the RealSense line. I intend to build a hand-held 3D scanning device with it.</li><li><a href="https://store.neurosky.com/pages/mindwave" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NeuroSky MindWave</a>: This is a brainwave sensing device that gives applications a sense of the level of concentration a user is applying to a task, or their level of calmness/anxiety. It's relatively inexpensive and really easy to use, so I'm investigating using it as a means of controlling parameters in selection systems, either to making picking of small objects easier/more precise, or scaling back difficulty level during periods of high anxiety.</li><li><a href="https://www.leapmotion.com/technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Leap Motion</a>: I have one of the Leap Motion PC Developer Kits, with various mounts I've designed with Sugru for better hand tracking when attached to a VR headset.</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect#Kinect_for_Xbox_One_(2013)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kinext for Xbox One</a>: I have the V2 Kinect, with the necessary cables for attaching to a PC instead of an Xbox One.</li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinect#Kinect_for_Windows_(2012)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Kinect for Windows</a>: I have the V1 Kinect, with the necessary cables for attaching to a PC instead of an Xbox 360.</li></ul><h3>In process</h3><p>These are headsets that I've ordered and are just waiting to receive.</p><ul><li><a href="https://enterprise.vive.com/us/product/vive-pro-eye/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTC Vive Pro Eye</a>: I'm interested in playing with the eye tracking. Just waiting on my order to fulfill.</li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft HoloLens 2</a>: Just wating for Microsoft to deem I'm worthy of a pre-order.</li><li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Valve Index</a>: Just waiting on my per-order to fulfill.</li><li><a href="https://pimaxvr.com/products/5kplus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pimax 5K Plus</a>: Just wating on my order to fulfill.</li><li><a href="https://www.nreal.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nreal light</a>: This is a really interesting AR headset that tethers to smartphones. I'm waiting to see if I get approved for their developer program.</li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/azure-kinect-dk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure Kinect DK</a>: I have the Kinect with Azure services on pre-order.</li></ul><h3>Wish-list</h3><p>These are headsets that I'd be willing to buy, for the right price, but may not have any particular need for, given the other headsets I own. Listed by order of interest:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-vr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation VR</a>: I don't have a PlayStation 4, but if I had a PSVR, I would buy one. Please <a href="mailto:sean@seanmcbeth.com?Subject=Pico Neo">email me</a> if you're looking to sell one.</li><li><a href="https://www.vive.com/us/cosmos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vive Cosmos</a>: For the sake of completion, I might as well have one.</li><li><a href="https://www.pico-interactive.com/neo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pico Neo</a>: With the Oculus Quest release, these look a tad expensive now. I might pick one up in the near future, but if you have one you're looking to offload, please <a href="mailto:sean@seanmcbeth.com?Subject=Pico Neo">email me</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.pico-interactive.com/g2-4k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pico Goblin 2</a>: Again, these aren't so desirable from a technology standpoint given the other headsets available in the market, but having one would be a good addition to my library. If you have a standard Pico G2 or a Pico G2 4K that you're looking to offload, please <a href="mailto:sean@seanmcbeth.com?Subject=Pico G2">email me</a>.</li><li><a href="https://varjo.com/xr-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Varjo XR-1</a>: Judging from the Varjo VR-1 prices, this is going to be hella expensive. But the technical specs are very interesting. I've signed up for their mailing list, just waiting on purchase availability announcement.</li><li><a href="https://varjo.com/vr-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Varjo VR-1</a>: These things are super expensive and I won't be buying one anytime soon. But it's useful to have it in the list, in case I end up stumbling on a chest of gold dubloons or something.</li></ul></section></main></body></html>
