        p I am a freelance software consultant in virtual reality, augmented reality, games, simulation, graphics, abstract data visualization, audio synthesis and processing, computer vision, peer-to-peer networking, desktop, Web, mobile, real-time communication, hardware prototyping, embedded systems, reporting, GIS, and relational database systems.

        p My current work is focused on Virtual Reality and electronics. I've successfully bootstrapped and deployed multiple VR projects for Google Cardboard and HTC Vive, as well as a few hardware prototypes in radio and wireless input devices. Before VR, I built several analytics-heavy OLTP applications for desktop, Web, and mobile Web.

        p My projects usually go from concept to first-version in 1-to-2-month timeframes. I emphasize open communication with stakeholders, frequent issue and user-story tracking and review, correct, normalized relational database design and simple, best-practice-based, DRY, agile software development. I maintain an extremely broad set of skills to bring to bear on your project.
