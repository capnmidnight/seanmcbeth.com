The JAR application will provide you with random maps. Your task is to "herd" a sheep to the top of the tallest hill by clicking on the top of that hill. After moving a sheep to a hill, hit 'E' on your keyboard to advance to the next map. You will be given 5 maps. Once you have finished the survey, send the survey completion code to <font color="red">[email address removed, survey complete]</font> with the subject line "Test Results".<p>

With a properly configured system, double clicking the JAR file will run it like a normal program.
