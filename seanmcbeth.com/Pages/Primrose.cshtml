<h1>Primrose</h1>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.primrosevr.com/">Primrose</a> was the world's first JavaScript framework for developing WebXR applications, back when WebXR was still called "WebVR".
    My first release of Primrose was sometime in 2014, almost a full year before Mozilla's A-Frame. I built Primrose with the
    purpose of being able to create cross-platform, multiuser, live-editable VR environments. <a href="https://www.github.com/capnmidnight/Primrose/" aria-label="Primrose on git hub">View the Primrose GitHub repository</a>.

    Today, I've moved the WebXR framework portions of Primrose to <a href="https://www.github.com/capnmidnight/Juniper">Juniper</a>.
    Primrose is now just the syntax-highlighting text-editor that renders to an HTML5 Canvas element. Rendering to an HTML Canvas
    element makes it useful for using as a texture in WebGL contexts.
