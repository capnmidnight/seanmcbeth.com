                This basic AI chat-bot experiment uses Speech-to-Text technology
                and some clever prompting of an OpenAI LLM to generate characterized
                responses, which are then piped out to a Text-to-Speech engine,
                with a lip-sync visualization.
            </p><p>
                I've found it to be an entertaining distraction to start conversations
                with the AI, change up characters, and build out fake "Podcasts" from
                the exported audio. Check the <em>"Examples tab"</em> for links to
                a few of them
            </p>

                Grant the <em>Microphone Permission</em> when the page loads. Without it, there
                is no other way to interface with the AI.
            </p><p>
                Use the <em>Output tab</em> to change characters and output language. There is
                also an "Additional prompt" field in which you can provide extra
                background on the conversation, like character background notes,
                or situational details.
            </p><p>
                Check the <em>Input tab</em> to make sure your microphone and language settings
                are correct. The input language doesn't matter too much, but it's helpful
                in the context I originally wrote this demo: building conversation
                practice tools for learning foreign languages.
            </p><p>
                Click the <em>"Start listening"</em> button to begin recording speech. The app
                attempts to detect quiet spaces around your utterances, so you don't
                need to click <em>"Stop listening"</em> in between each of your prompts.
            </p><p>
                However, if you're in a noisy environment, or your speakers are turned
                up too loud and your microphone ends up hearing the generated speech
                and interprets it as your own speech, you can use the "Start/stop"
                button to pause recording when you're done talking to avoid erroneous
                prompt recordings
            </p><p>
                The <em>"Reprompt"</em> button will force another reply from the AI without
                requiring your verbal input.
            </p><p>
                The <em>"Export"</em> button will concatenate all of the audio clips, both
                your own and the AI's generated clips, into a single audio file,
                which you can then do with as you wish.
