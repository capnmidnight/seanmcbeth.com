    <p>
        Primrose was the world's first JavaScript framework for developing WebXR applications, back when WebXR was still called "WebVR".
        My first release of Primrose was sometime in 2014, almost a full year before Mozilla's A-Frame. I built Primrose with the
        purpose of being able to create cross-platform, multiuser, live-editable VR environments.
    </p>

    <img src="~/img/primrose.jpeg" alt="Screenshot from Primrose" title="Primrose Text Editor" />

    <p>
        Today, I've moved the WebXR framework portions of Primrose to <a href="https://www.github.com/capnmidnight/Juniper">Juniper</a>.
        Primrose is now just the syntax-highlighting text-editor that renders to an HTML5 Canvas element. Rendering to an HTML Canvas
        element makes it useful for using as a texture in WebGL contexts.
